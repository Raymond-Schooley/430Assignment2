TCSS 430 Assignment 2 - Group 5
*******************************


INTRODUCTION
------------

This application was coded using Python and was an assignment for University of Washington Tacoma's
TCSS 430 Networking and Distributed Systems class. 

This application queries the operating system and runs several diagnostic tools on the network.
The application then parses the output from the diagnostic tools and is formatted in a user-friendly
command line interface and provides an option to print out the generated results.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Operating System: Windows

Programming Language: Python

Modules: subprocess, os, re

NOTE: As of July 2018, these modules are a part of the Python Standard Library and no further installation
      is needed.


CONFIGURATION & RUNTIME
-----------------------

When first starting the application, the application prints out the users network information using
the ipconfig command. The information printed are the user's IPv6 and IPv4 addresses and the subnet mask.

The user then is shown a prompt to input a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or an IP address to run
the commands ping and tracert. The appropriate command options are dynamically run based on the user
input. 

The outputs from the diagnostic tools are saved onto networkconfigoutput.txt.

At the end of the application, the user is given an option to print out the results saved onto 
networkconfigoutput.txt.
